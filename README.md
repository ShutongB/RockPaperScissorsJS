# Overview

The rock-paper-scissors project is a simple JavaScript application that allows users to play the classic game against the computer. The application demonstrates the use of JavaScript to handle user interactions, generate random choices for the computer, and determine the game outcome.

The purpose of creating this software was to further my learning as a software engineer and practice JavaScript programming. By building this project, I aimed to improve my understanding of JavaScript syntax, control flow, and event handling.

In the YouTube demonstration video linked below, I provide a 4-5 minute walkthrough of the software running and explain the code structure and key concepts. The focus of the demonstration is to share what I learned about JavaScript language syntax and how it was applied in this project.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:

- VSCode
- Git
- Github
- Javascript
- HTML

The software is written entirely in JavaScript, making use of standard language features and DOM manipulation to create the game interface and handle user interactions. No external libraries or frameworks were used in this project.

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, the following websites were particularly helpful:

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/): An invaluable resource for JavaScript documentation and examples.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/): Provides comprehensive tutorials and references for web development technologies, including JavaScript.

# Future Work

Although the current version of the rock-paper-scissors game is functional, there are several areas for potential improvement and future work:

- Implement a better user interface design to enhance the visual appeal.
- Add animations or transitions to provide a more engaging experience.
- Include sound effects or background music to make the game more immersive.
- Implement a scoring system to keep track of the user's overall performance.
- Allow for multiplayer functionality, enabling users to play against each other.
- Optimize the code for better performance and maintainability.
- Add unit tests to ensure the correctness of the game logic.
